# Syntax

``using`` is like an import. ``class`` is for organization, for storing functions and values.

Function decleration:
```c#
public static void myFunctions() {
```

This is a public function that can be called outside of the ``class``.

```c#
private static void myFunction() {
```

This is a private function that can only be called in a ``class``.
